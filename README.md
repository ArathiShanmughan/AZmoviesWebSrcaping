# AZmoviesWebSrcaping

This study analyzes movie data from AZMovies by implementing a structured data pipeline that includes web scraping, data cleaning, normalization, storage, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Using Scrapy and Selenium, movie details such as titles, genres, ratings, directors, production details, and release dates were extracted and stored in an SQLite database for efficient querying and analysis. The data was cleaned to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency, while the database was designed following Third Normal Form (3NF) principles for optimized storage and retrieval. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), key insights were uncovered, including Fantasy, Adventure, and Family as the most popular genres, the United States leading global movie production, and a general increase in movie releases after 2000. It was observed that longer movies tend to have higher IMDb ratings, and renowned directors significantly influence movie success.
